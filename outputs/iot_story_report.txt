IOT SENSOR DATASET – WEEKLY INTERPRETATION

1. Dataset overview
- Time span: 2025-03-01 00:00:00 to 2025-03-07 23:59:55 (~7.0 days).
- Number of records: 120,960 at ~5.0-second intervals.
- Available sensors: temperature, humidity, light.

2. Day–night behaviour
- Daytime defined by time: 06:00–18:00; night = outside this range.
- Median light level ≈ 548.91 lux. Values rarely approach 0 and never reach direct sunlight levels, which suggests an indoor or artificially lit environment.
- Fraction of time labelled as day: 50.0% (night: 50.0%).
- Temperature:
  • Day: mean=22.50, min=20.00, max=25.00
  • Night: mean=22.50, min=20.00, max=25.00
  • Interpretation: temperature is almost the same in day and night.
- Humidity:
  • Day: mean=50.03, min=40.00, max=60.00
  • Night: mean=50.02, min=40.00, max=60.00
  • Interpretation: humidity is almost the same in day and night.
- Light:
  • Day: mean=548.69, min=100.00, max=999.99
  • Night: mean=549.52, min=100.00, max=999.99
  • Interpretation: light is slightly higher at night.

3. Hourly behaviour and daily peak hours
- The signals were resampled to 1-hour intervals to compute mean, minimum, and maximum values for temperature, humidity, and light.
- For each day, the hottest, most humid, and brightest hour were extracted:
  • 2025-03-01: hottest at 05:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.60 °C), most humid at 06:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.52 %), brightest at 11:00 (mean light ≈ 568.75 lux)
  • 2025-03-02: hottest at 08:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.58 °C), most humid at 01:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.63 %), brightest at 04:00 (mean light ≈ 561.60 lux)
  • 2025-03-03: hottest at 18:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.60 °C), most humid at 08:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.44 %), brightest at 08:00 (mean light ≈ 563.32 lux)
  • 2025-03-04: hottest at 23:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.59 °C), most humid at 06:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.40 %), brightest at 22:00 (mean light ≈ 570.34 lux)
  • 2025-03-05: hottest at 13:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.60 °C), most humid at 22:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.55 %), brightest at 04:00 (mean light ≈ 571.07 lux)
  • 2025-03-06: hottest at 02:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.59 °C), most humid at 13:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.45 %), brightest at 09:00 (mean light ≈ 574.81 lux)
  • 2025-03-07: hottest at 17:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.58 °C), most humid at 07:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.52 %), brightest at 02:00 (mean light ≈ 568.19 lux)

4. Hottest, most humid, and brightest day of the week
- Hottest day (by average temperature): 2025-03-07 with daily mean temperature ≈ 22.51.
- Most humid day (by average humidity): 2025-03-06 with daily mean humidity ≈ 50.07.
- Brightest day (by average light level): 2025-03-05 with daily mean light ≈ 550.99.

5. Relationships between temperature, humidity, and light
- Temperature vs humidity: correlation = +0.00 (very weak, positive relationship).
- Temperature vs light: correlation = -0.00 (very weak, negative relationship).
- Humidity vs light: correlation = -0.00 (very weak, negative relationship).

6. Overall statistics for the full week
- Temperature: mean=22.50, min=20.00, max=25.00, variance=2.08.
- Humidity: mean=50.03, min=40.00, max=60.00, variance=33.26.
- Light: mean=549.10, min=100.00, max=999.99, variance=67457.73.

7. Anomaly detection (±3σ, 10-minute rolling window)
- No anomalies were detected for any sensor using the 3σ rule. The environment appears very stable with no extreme spikes.

8. Interpretation
- Maximum light levels are around 1000 lux, which is far below direct sunlight and more consistent with indoor or artificial lighting. This is why time-based day/night labelling was used as the main reference, while light intensity was used to support the interpretation.
- Temperature and humidity are almost constant over days and nights, and across the full week. This suggests a controlled environment where heating, cooling, and moisture levels are regulated.
- There is no clear natural daily cycle and no strong correlation between the sensors, confirming that the system is not simply reacting to outdoor weather but is running in a stable, indoor regime.
