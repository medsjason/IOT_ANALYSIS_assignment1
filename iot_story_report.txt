3. Hourly behaviour and daily peak hours
- Data was resampled to 1-hour windows to compute mean, minimum, and maximum values for temperature, humidity, and light.
  • 2025-03-01: hottest at 05:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.60), most humid at 06:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.52), brightest at 11:00 (mean light ≈ 568.75 lux)
  • 2025-03-02: hottest at 08:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.58), most humid at 01:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.63), brightest at 04:00 (mean light ≈ 561.60 lux)
  • 2025-03-03: hottest at 18:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.60), most humid at 08:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.44), brightest at 08:00 (mean light ≈ 563.32 lux)
  • 2025-03-04: hottest at 23:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.59), most humid at 06:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.40), brightest at 22:00 (mean light ≈ 570.34 lux)
  • 2025-03-05: hottest at 13:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.60), most humid at 22:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.55), brightest at 04:00 (mean light ≈ 571.07 lux)
  • 2025-03-06: hottest at 02:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.59), most humid at 13:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.45), brightest at 09:00 (mean light ≈ 574.81 lux)
  • 2025-03-07: hottest at 17:00 (mean temperature ≈ 22.58), most humid at 07:00 (mean humidity ≈ 50.52), brightest at 02:00 (mean light ≈ 568.19 lux)

4. Daily extremes across the seven days
- hottest day (by average temperature): 2025-03-07 with daily mean temperature ≈ 22.51.
- most humid day (by average humidity): 2025-03-06 with daily mean humidity ≈ 50.07.
- brightest day (by average light level): 2025-03-05 with daily mean light ≈ 550.99.

5. Relationships between sensors (correlation)
- Temperature vs humidity: correlation = +0.00 (very weak, positive relationship).
- Temperature vs light: correlation = -0.00 (very weak, negative relationship).
- Humidity vs light: correlation = -0.00 (very weak, negative relationship).

6. Overall statistics per sensor
- Temperature: mean=22.50, min=20.00, max=25.00, variance=2.08.
- Humidity: mean=50.03, min=40.00, max=60.00, variance=33.26.
- Light: mean=549.10, min=100.00, max=999.99, variance=67457.73.
- Ph: mean=7.00, min=6.00, max=8.00, variance=0.33.
- Electrical_conductivity: mean=1.25, min=0.50, max=2.00, variance=0.19.

7. Anomaly detection summary (±3σ, 10-minute rolling window)
- No anomalies detected for the monitored sensors under the 3σ criterion.

8. High-level interpretation
- The monitored environment shows controlled variations in temperature and humidity, with only mild differences between day and night.
- Light intensity remains within a limited range, consistent with artificial illumination rather than direct sunlight.
- Because of this behaviour, day versus night is defined primarily from the timestamp, while light is used mainly to interpret how illumination changes.
- The absence or low occurrence of 3σ anomalies suggests that no severe sensor faults or extreme environmental events occurred during the monitored week.
